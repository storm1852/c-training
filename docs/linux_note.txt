Linux
Linux applications are represented by two special types of files: 
executables and scripts.
1.  Executable files
are programs that can be run directly by the computer; they correspond to Windows .exe files
2. scripts as .cmd .bat

--
$ gcc -o hello hello.c
$ ./hello
Hello World
--
 translated the C source code into an executable file called hello

/usr/bin

---- Header Files --  /usr/include (/sys or /linux)
- provide definitions of constants and
- declarations for system and library function calls
- /usr/include/X11 for the X Window System 
- /usr/include/c++ for GNU C++

$ gcc -I/usr/openwin/include fred.c

$ grep EXIT_ *.h
Here grep searches all the files in the directory with a name ending in .h for the string EXIT_.

---- Library Files -- /lib  or  /usr/lib
 - collections of precompiled functions that have been written to be reusable
 - sets of related functions to perform a common task
 ex:  database access routines (the dbm library), screen-handling
functions (the curses and ncurses libraries)

.a for traditional, static libraries
.so for shared libraries (see the following)

$ gcc -o fred fred.c /usr/lib/libm.a
s the compiler to compile file fred.c, call the resulting program file fred, and search the mathematical
library in addition to the standard C library to resolve references to functions

$ gcc -o fred fred.c -lm
-lm notation is that the compiler will automatically choose the shared library
when it exists

$ gcc -o x11fred -L/usr/openwin/lib x11fred.c -lX11
 compile and link a program called x11fred using the version of the library libX11 found in the
/usr/openwin/lib directory

--- Static Libraries .a
â€“l  to indicate which libraries other than the standard C runtime library
You can create and maintain your own static libraries very easily by using the ar (for archive) program
and compiling functions separately with gcc -c

$ ar crv libfoo.a bill.o fred.o
use ar to create archives of files of any type

$ ranlib libfoo.a
require that a table of contents be created for
the library. Do this with the ranlib command
